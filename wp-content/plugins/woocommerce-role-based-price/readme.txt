== Description ==
This plugin can make your simple WooCommerce shop in to multi currency and price level marketplace where products can be offered at different prices for different customer groups. 
For example, Subscribers or Contributors get different prices than new customers. Differentiate your registered users to get your shop more attractive. New roles can be created and managed. 


Latest version have been greatly improved for smoother and more speedy functioning, all user interfaces have been improved for more friendly user/webmaster experience. It is now WPML ready straight of of box. 

We have added built-in plugin extension marketplace for more PRO level functions that not all might need but we think they are very useful. Please check full feature list below.
